# Change Proposals

This directory contains change proposals following the OpenSpec workflow.

## What is a Change Proposal?

A change proposal documents a planned change to the system, including:

- **Why**: Problem statement and motivation
- **What**: Summary of changes
- **Impact**: Affected components and stakeholders
- **How**: Design and implementation plan

## Change Proposal Structure

Each change is in its own directory with:

```
changes/
└── change-id/
    ├── proposal.md    # Why, what, impact
    ├── design.md      # Technical design
    ├── tasks.md       # Implementation tasks
    └── specs/         # Specification changes
```

## How to Create a Change Proposal

Use the `/pkp-change` command:

```bash
/pkp-change add-payment-gateway
```
