# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made in this project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: The circumstances and constraints
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered
- **Consequences**: The results of the decision (positive, negative, neutral)

## How to Create an ADR

Use the `/pkp-adr` command:

```bash
/pkp-adr "Use PostgreSQL over MongoDB"
```

## ADR List
